== HilbertVisGUI: Installation Instructions ==
==============================================

The present package is meant to be used with the statistics programming
language R. It is also possible to use HilbertCurveDisplay as a stand-alone 
application, without R, but I have not yet made this option into a package. 
If you need it, please contact me.

Prerequesites:
--------------

You need to have installed a reasonably recent version of R, at least
R 2.6.0, and the 'gtkmm' library for GTK+ 2.4, the latter with header files.

For R, see http://www.r-project.org/

In order to see whether you have gtkmm installed, type at the command prompt
  pkg-config --modversion gtkmm-2.4
If you do not get any output, gtkmm-2.4 is missing or cannot be found by 
pkg-config.

In most Linux systems, you only need to use your distribution's package manager
and install the gtkmm development package. See the following URL to learn how
the package is called on the different distributions:
   http://www.gtkmm.org/download.shtml
   
Note that at the above URL, there is also a Fink package for use with MacOS X.

For Windows, you can find binaries of gtkmm on the Gnome FTP server. As of
now, the URL is
   http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtkmm/
Note that you need the 'gtkmm-win32-devel' package only if you want to install 
HilbertCurveDisplay from source. if you have a pre-compiled binary
package, the 'gtkmm-win32-runtime' package is sufficient.


Installation:
-------------

Once gtkmm is properly installed on your system, you can install
HilbertCurveDisplay with R's install function:
   R CMD INSTALL path/to/HilbertVisGUI
   

Note:
-----
I have not yet verified that the installation instructions for Mac and
Windows really work as described, but will do so as soon as I get hold
of a machine with these operating systems.
