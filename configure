# these, displays a message with explanation on how to install gtkmm.
# This is meant to save the inexperienced user from getting an
# incomprehensible error message when pkg-config in src/Makevars fails.

   | The 'pkg-config' utility could not find the library and header
   | files for 'gtkmm-2.4'. 'gtkmm' and the GTK+ framework are required
   | to build the present package.
   
   | Don't worry. For most modern Linux distribution, it is pretty easy
   | to install these. Just use your distribution's package manage, search 
   | for the gtkmm package and install it. Make sure that you install
   | the developer version of the package. It is usually called 
   | 'gtkmm-2.4-dev', 'gtkmm-2.4-devel', 'gtkmm-dev', 'gtkmm-devel', or
   | similarily.
